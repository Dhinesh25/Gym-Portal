 <p>"Fitness" is a broad term that means something different to each person, but it refers to your own optimal health and overall well-being. Being fit not only means physical health, but emotional and mental health, too. It defines every aspect of your health. Smart eating and active living are fundamental to fitness.

According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' Complete Food and Nutrition Guide (3rd ed.), when you are fit, you have:
Energy to do what's important to you and to be more productive
Stamina and a positive outlook to handle the mental challenges and emotional ups and downs of everyday life and to deal with stress
Reduced risk for many health problems, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and osteoporosis
The chance to look and feel your best
Physical strength and endurance to accomplish physical challenges
A better chance for a higher quality of life and perhaps a longer life, too.Fitness includes five essential components, flexibility, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular endurance, muscular strength, and body composition. Fitness is vitally important to health and wellness as well as to the ability to engage in normal activities of daily living (ADLs) without excessive fatigue. Physical activity and exercise training programs should be designed with the intent of improving each of the key components of health-related physical fitness in addition to preventing chronic disease (e.g. heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis etc.)

<p>Fitness is the ability to function efficiently in an active environment that suits your personal interests and goals. You should have your own unique definition and create a baseline that you can build on throughout your life.
Your fitness goals should always be realistic and something you look forward to as part of your active lifestyle. Whether it's running a marathon or taking a walk, always operate in an environment that you can manage. Functional fitness refers to how well you’re able to do all the physical tasks you need to do each day. For example, if you’re functionally fit, you can carry a bag of groceries without strain, bend down to pick up laundry from the floor without pulling a muscle, lift a child without injuring your back or even perform regular exercise. A large factor in functional fitness is flexibility - and staying active can help. Movement helps loosen up the body, keeping muscles limber.
Fitness
Exercising for 30 minutes at least 5 days a week makes you look and feel better while reducing your risks for many chronic conditions. Physical activity boosts your immune system and mental sharpness, and helps you avoid obesity, diabetes, cancer and heart problems.
